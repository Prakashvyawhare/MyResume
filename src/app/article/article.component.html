<div> <h4  style="text-align: center;">About</h4>
<p>As a fresher in web development, I wanted to improve my skills and experience by creating a resume web application as a practice exercise. This project would not only allow me to showcase my web development skills but also improve my portfolio and create a unique application that I can use in the future. </p>    

<p>My web application features a clean and modern design that is easy to navigate, and provides all the necessary information that a potential employer would need to see. The homepage contains an "about me" section, which includes my name, contact information, and a brief summary of my skills and experience. </p>    
    
    
 <p>I also created a portfolio section in my web application, which showcases some of the best web development projects I have worked on. Each project includes a brief description, the technologies I used, and a link to the project itself. This portfolio section is an excellent way to demonstrate my skills and abilities as a web developer, and to highlight some of the work that I'm most proud of. </p>    
    
 <p>To ensure that my web application is responsive and mobile-friendly, I used best practices in web development and tested the application on different devices and browsers. I also made sure that my web application is optimized for performance and security, and that it follows industry-standard web development practices. </p>    
    
  <p>Overall, creating a resume web application was a great practice exercise that allowed me to showcase my web development skills, create a unique application, and improve my portfolio. I believe that this web application will be a valuable asset as I continue my career in web development.
